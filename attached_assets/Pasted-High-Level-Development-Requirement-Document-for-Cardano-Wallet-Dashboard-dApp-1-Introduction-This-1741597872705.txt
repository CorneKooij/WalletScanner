High-Level Development Requirement Document for Cardano Wallet Dashboard dApp
1. Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive set of requirements for the development of a decentralized application (dApp) on the Cardano blockchain. The dApp will enable users to input a wallet ID or handle and view a detailed dashboard displaying the wallet's holdings, trade history, and NFT visualizations. The dashboard will feature interactive graphs for holdings, allowing users to explore data across customizable time intervals. This document covers all requirements across the complete development lifecycle, from planning to maintenance.
2. Objectives
User Accessibility: Develop a user-friendly interface that accepts a wallet ID or handle and presents detailed information about the wallet’s assets and activities.

Data Visualization: Provide interactive and insightful visualizations of wallet holdings over time, enhancing user understanding of their financial data.

Quality Assurance: Ensure the dApp is secure, performs efficiently, and scales effectively to meet user demand.
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 User Input
The dApp must accept a wallet ID or handle as user input.

Validate the input to ensure it corresponds to a valid Cardano wallet address, resolving handles (e.g., human-readable names) to their associated wallet addresses if applicable.
3.2 Data Fetching
Retrieve the wallet’s current holdings, including ADA (Cardano’s native cryptocurrency) and other native tokens.

Fetch the wallet’s trade history, encompassing all transactions such as sends, receives, and interactions with smart contracts (if applicable).

Obtain data on NFTs owned by the wallet, including metadata (e.g., name, description, attributes) and media (e.g., images, videos).
3.3 Dashboard Display
Holdings Section:
Display current balances of ADA and other fungible tokens, with quantities clearly listed.

Present an interactive graph plotting holdings over time, with options to select time intervals (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, all time).
Trade History Section:
List all transactions involving the wallet, including:
Date and time

Transaction type (e.g., send, receive)

Amount and token involved

Counterparty address (with an option to view on a block explorer)

Transaction fee

Link to the transaction on a Cardano block explorer
NFT Visualization Section:
Display a gallery of NFTs owned by the wallet, showing for each:
Image or media preview

Name

Description

Attributes or traits

Collection details (if available)
3.4 Interactivity
Enable interactive features on holdings graphs, such as zooming, panning, and selecting specific time ranges.

Provide filtering and sorting options for trade history (e.g., by date, token, or transaction type) and NFTs (e.g., by collection or attribute).
4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Performance
Optimize data fetching and processing to ensure quick load times, even for wallets with extensive transaction histories or large NFT collections.

Implement pagination or lazy loading for trade history and NFT displays to manage large datasets efficiently.
4.2 Security
Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks or misuse.

Ensure the dApp does not store or expose sensitive wallet information beyond what is publicly available on the blockchain.
4.3 Usability
Design an intuitive and responsive user interface compatible with various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Include clear labels, tooltips, and a help section to assist users in navigating the dashboard.
4.4 Reliability
Handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful feedback (e.g., “Invalid wallet ID” or “Data unavailable”) to users.

Ensure data accuracy by sourcing information directly from the Cardano blockchain or verifiable APIs.
4.5 Scalability
Architect the dApp to support multiple concurrent users and handle increased request volumes without performance degradation.
5. Technology Stack
Front-end:
Framework: React (or similar modern JavaScript framework) for building a dynamic, responsive interface.

Visualization: Chart.js (or D3.js) for creating interactive graphs.
Data Fetching:
Utilize a Cardano blockchain API such as Blockfrost to query wallet data, transaction history, and NFT metadata.
Hosting:
Deploy the dApp on decentralized storage like IPFS for alignment with blockchain principles, or use traditional web hosting for simplicity and reliability.
6. Development Lifecycle
6.1 Planning and Requirement Gathering
Collaborate with stakeholders to refine requirements and define detailed user stories.

Develop wireframes and mockups to visualize the dashboard layout and user flow.

Establish acceptance criteria for each feature.
6.2 Design
Create a detailed UI/UX design, focusing on usability and visual appeal.

Select color schemes, fonts, and layouts that enhance readability and accessibility.

Ensure the design adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
6.3 Development
Set up the development environment with necessary tools and dependencies.

Implement front-end components for input handling, data display, and interactivity.

Integrate with the chosen blockchain API to fetch and process wallet data.

Develop logic for data aggregation (e.g., daily balances for graphs) and visualization.
6.4 Testing
Write unit tests for critical functions (e.g., input validation, data processing).

Perform integration testing to verify seamless interaction between the front-end and API.

Conduct user acceptance testing with sample wallet IDs to ensure functionality meets requirements.

Test across multiple browsers and devices for compatibility.
6.5 Deployment
Select and configure a hosting solution (e.g., IPFS or a traditional web server).

Deploy the dApp, ensuring all components function correctly in the live environment.

Set up monitoring tools to track performance and detect issues post-launch.
6.6 Maintenance
Monitor user feedback and system logs to identify bugs or areas for improvement.

Plan regular updates to address issues, enhance features, or adapt to Cardano blockchain upgrades.

Maintain documentation and version control for ongoing development.
7. Additional Considerations
Accessibility: Incorporate features like screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and high-contrast modes to ensure the dApp is accessible to users with disabilities.

Transparency: Consider open-sourcing the code to align with blockchain community standards, allowing users to verify functionality and contribute to development.

Future Enhancements: Plan for potential features such as:
Real-time data updates via polling or websockets.

Support for displaying token values in USD (using a price API).

Multi-wallet comparison functionality.
8. Conclusion
This high-level requirement document provides a roadmap for developing a Cardano wallet dashboard dApp that meets user needs for detailed financial insights. By addressing functional and non-functional requirements across the entire development lifecycle, the dApp will deliver a robust, interactive, and user-centric experience while leveraging Cardano’s blockchain capabilities. Detailed specifications and technical designs should follow this document to guide implementation.
