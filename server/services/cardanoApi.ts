// This file previously contained sample data and a redundant fetchWalletData function.
// The core logic for fetching wallet data is now handled by blockfrostService.ts.
// Keeping the file empty for now, or removing it if it's not imported anywhere.
// I will check imports in routes.ts before deleting.
